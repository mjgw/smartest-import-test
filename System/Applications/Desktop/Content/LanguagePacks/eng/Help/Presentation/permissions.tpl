<p>In order to function, smartest needs to be able to store certain content and information on the hard disk of your server. There are certain locations on the web server within your Smartest installation where this takes place.</p>
<p>Many people don't know that within the system of user accounts that regulate who can access or modify which files on the server, the web server software, such as Apache, often has its own user account. This is for security reasons.</p>
<p>Frequently, when people install a system such as Smartest that will by run by a web server, the files and folders are owned by the user who installed the software, rather than by the web server's own user account. In this case, the server's operating system will very stop it from being able to save files into folders that it does not own, because those folders belong to you, the user. It's a basic security mechanism, but in this case, it's a bit too basic.</p>
<p>This is not a bug - it's just a question of changing the permissions on the right folders so that Smartest (via the web server software) will be allowed to write files there. Most FTP programs allow this if you 'get info' on a folder, and any server administrator can change this for you in seconds.</p>
