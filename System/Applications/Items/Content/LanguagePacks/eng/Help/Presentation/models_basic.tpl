<p>Models allow your website to store structured data that can be displayed on your web pages and cleanly organized.<p>
<p>A model is the 'type' to which an item - a single unit of data - belongs. It provides structure and shape to one or more items, and two items that share the same model will have the same possible attributes. For example, if you were storing information about cars, you'd create a 'Car' model, and the properties you create for it might be things like make, model, color, year, and so forth, each of which might be a different {help id="datamanager:datatypes"}type of information{/help}.</p>
<p>Some of the columns, such as <em>Name</em>, are built in, but most are created by you, the user, in the context of whatever type of information you are storing.</p>
<p>Each model is therefore similar to a single spreadsheet or table. It has a number of <strong>properties</strong>, which are akin to the columns of the table.</p>
